# Python_Projects

This repository contains various Python projects I've been working on to understand the basics of the Python programming language. As I learn new concepts and techniques, I'll be adding different projects that demonstrate my progress and understanding.

## Current Projects

### 1. Slot Machine CLI (Python)
A simple command-line slot machine program that I'm building to practice fundamental Python concepts like loops, functions, dictionaries, and user input validation.

**What I'm learning from this project:**
- Working with dictionaries and nested data structures
- Input validation and error handling
- While loops and control flow
- Function definitions and parameter passing
- Random number generation and probability

**Features in progress:**
- Slot machine spin mechanics using random selection
- Payout calculation logic
- Win/loss determination
- Game loop for multiple rounds

**How to run:**
1. Make sure you have Python 3 (preferably Python 3.6+) installed
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Run: `python slot_machine.py`

## Learning Goals

Through these projects, I'm focusing on mastering:
- Python syntax and basic programming concepts
- Data structures (lists, dictionaries, tuples)
- Control structures (loops, conditionals)
- Functions and modular programming
- Error handling and user input validation
- Working with Python's standard library

## Future Projects

I plan to add more projects as I continue learning, potentially including:
- Simple games and puzzles
- Data manipulation exercises
- Basic web scraping projects
- File handling and data processing scripts
